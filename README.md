Final project of my Programming I Course

If the person whose trying to purchase the ticket is over 65 years old, they get a discount.
If the person whose trying to purchase the ticket is a minor, they get a discount.

The owner of the cinema can delete all the reservations for the day if they choose to. They can also see how well the cinema did on that specific day:
They can see the available seats, occupied seats and the total amount of money collected on that day.
